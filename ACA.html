        <h2>ACA Script</h2>
        <p>Hi, this is ___ calling you from the Subsidy Department.<br>
        Well, how are you doing today?</p>
        <p>The reason for my call is just to let you know that your name and number have been selected to receive some free subsidy money where you can qualify for $500 to $1200 each, and along with additional benefits which you never have to pay back.</p>
        <p>You also don’t need to provide any of your personal or banking information. This is a totally free scheme coming through the Government, and you don’t have to pay a single dollar out of pocket.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>✅ Benefits Overview</h2>
        <p>In this call, you will get 2 benefits from the government:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Self-Development Benefit</strong> – You will receive government benefits and lots of rewards.</li>
            <li><strong>Overage Benefits</strong> – Like grocery support, free health insurance, and gift cards for referrals.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And again – you never have to pay anything.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>📝 Qualification Questions</h2>
        <p>Now, may I know your age (21–64)?</p>
        <p>Okay! So let me tell you why your name and number has been selected: Due to recession, Govt used to make a survey of those people who pay their bills and taxes time to time, and from every state, 50 numbers get selected — and your number is one of them. That’s why you’re selected, okay?</p>
        <p>So, this time, all these benefits are coming from the Health Insurance Department, which is why you will need to speak with my Health Insurance Advisor. They will ask you some simple qualifying questions.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>🖊️ Preparation</h2>
        <p>Now is that possible — can you grab a pen and piece of paper so you can write down every question with the answer?</p>
        <div class="instruction">
            <strong>If customer says “Hold on, let me grab it”</strong><br>
            ➡️ Okay, you can take your time and let me know when you are ready. Alright?
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>✅ Main Questions</h2>
        <p class="question">Q1: Do you have any health insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid?</p>
        <p class="answer">✅ Say: “No, I don’t have anything.”</p>
        <div class="instruction">
            <strong>If the customer says they have Medicare or Medicaid, say:</strong><br>
            “Medicare or Medicaid is not primary health insurance; it’s secondary. So you should say: ‘No, I don’t have anything,’ or they will disqualify you.”
        </div>

        <p class="question">Q2: What plan are you looking for – individual or family?</p>
        <p class="answer">✅ Say: “Individual plan because I’m not married.”</p>

        <p class="question">Q3: What is your Annual Income?</p>

        <p class="answer">✅ Say: “Yes, I’m Working Full Time.”</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>💡 Reminder</h2>
        <p>Don’t panic — you won’t be asked to pay anything or give any personal information. Once you grab the information, you are fully qualified for this Govt Money. After these questions, they will provide you with health insurance information.</p>
        <p class="answer">✅ Just say: “Yes, I want this health insurance.”</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>📍 Final Verifications & Warning</h2>

                <li>If they say "Yes" — ❗ Repeat the instruction one time: “Please remember — this is a government call, and they don’t allow any kind of money, gifts, or benefits to be offered in exchange for answering. So your answer should be: ‘No, no one offered me anything to talk with you.’ Otherwise, they will disqualify you.”</li>
            </ul>
