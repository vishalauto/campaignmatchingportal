        <h2>FE Script</h2>
        <p>Hello, this is ___ calling you from the Subsidy Department.<br>
        Well, how are you doing today?</p>
        <p>The reason for my call is just to let you know that your name and number have been selected to receive some free subsidy money where you can qualify for $500 to $1200 each, and along with additional benefits which you never have to pay back.</p>
        <p>You also don’t need to provide any of your personal or banking information. This is a totally free scheme coming through the Government, and you don’t have to pay a single dollar out of pocket.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>✅ Benefits Overview</h2>
        <p>In this call, you will get 2 benefits from the government:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Self-Development Benefit</strong> – You will receive government benefits and lots of rewards.</li>
            <li><strong>Overage Benefits</strong> – Like grocery support, free health insurance, and gift cards for referrals.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And again – you never have to pay anything.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>📝 Qualification Questions</h2>
        <p>Now, may I know your age (50–80)?</p>
        <p>Okay! So let me tell you why your name and number has been selected: Due to recession, Govt used to make a survey of those people who pay their bills and taxes time to time, and from every state, 50 numbers get selected — and your number is one of them. That’s why you’re selected, okay?</p>
        <p>So, this time, all these benefits are coming from the Life Insurance Department, which is why you will need to speak with my Life Insurance Advisor. They will ask you some simple qualifying questions.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>🖊️ Preparation</h2>
        <p>Now is that possible — can you grab a pen and piece of paper so you can write down every question with the answer?</p>
        <div class="instruction">
            <strong>If customer says “Hold on, let me grab it”</strong><br>
            ➡️ Okay, you can take your time and let me know when you are ready. Alright?
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>✅ Main Questions</h2>
        <p class="question">Q1: Are you looking for Life Insurance or Final Expenses Insurance?</p>
        <p class="answer">✅ Simply tell them "Yes".</p>
        <div class="instruction">Let me tell you, you don’t have to get any insurance. Just for today, you need to show some interest toward Life Insurance, that’s it. Okay?</div>

        <p class="question">Q2: Are you currently hospitalized, in a nursing facility, or receiving Hospice or Home Health Care?</p>
        <p class="answer">✅ Say: “No.”</p>

        <p class="question">Q3: Are you currently diagnosed with any major health conditions such as an amputation, Alzheimer's, dementia, ALS, liver failure, kidney dialysis, organ transplant, AIDS, or HIV?</p>
        <p class="answer">✅ Say: “No.”</p>

        <p class="question">Q4: Do you have a valid method of payment like Checking Account, Saving Account, Visa, Master, or CashApp?</p>
        <p class="answer">✅ Say: “Yes, I have my account details with me.”</p>
        <div class="instruction">Again, they are just checking if you are really interested toward Life insurance or not, but you never have to pay anything.</div>

        <p class="question">Q5: What is your monthly budget for Final Expenses Insurance?</p>
        <p class="answer">✅ Say: “I can afford $40 to $60 per month.” Okay!</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>💡 Reminder</h2>
        <p>Don’t panic — you won’t be asked to pay anything or give any personal information. Once you grab the information, you are fully qualified for this Govt Money. After these questions, they will provide you with health insurance information.</p>
        <p class="answer">✅ Just say: “Yes, I want this Final Expenses insurance.”</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>📍 Final Verifications & Warning</h2>
        <p>Now, can you please verify your first and last name?<br>
        Can you verify your zip code?</p>
        <div class="warning">
            <p><strong>⚠️ Important Warning</strong></p>
            <p>Now, listen very carefully: They are from a different department – the Health Insurance Department. They will ask tricky questions to try to disqualify you.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="question">Q6: Did anyone offer you any kind of benefits, money, subsidies, incentives, grants, or a check to talk with us today?</p>
        <p>What will your smart answer be — Yes or No?</p>
        <div class="instruction">
            <strong>➡️ Customer Answer:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If they say "No" — ✅ Great! Go ahead to the next part.</li>
                <li>If they say "Yes" — ❗ Repeat the instruction one time: “Please remember — this is a government call, and they don’t allow any kind of money, gifts, or benefits to be offered in exchange for answering. So your answer should be: ‘No, no one offered me anything to talk with you.’ Otherwise, they will disqualify you.”</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="answer">✅ Final Answer: “No.”</p>

        <p class="question">They may also ask: Did anyone coach you on how to talk with me or answer questions?</p>
        <p class="answer">✅ Answer: “No one did that.”</p>

        <p>And I believe that you have 10 to 15 minutes to speak with the advisor, right? (If No – don’t transfer.)</p>

        <hr>
